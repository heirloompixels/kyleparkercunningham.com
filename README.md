# Kyle Parker Cunningham - Zola Portfolio Site

This is a Zola static site implementation for kyleparkercunningham.com, converted from Ghost CMS.

## Features

- **Minimal vanilla CSS**: No frameworks, clean and lightweight
- **Mobile-responsive**: Works on all screen sizes  
- **Fast loading**: Static files, minimal dependencies
- **Easy maintenance**: Pure Markdown content files
- **Long-term preservation**: Standard formats (HTML, CSS, Markdown)

## Development

### Build the site:
```bash
cd kpc-site
./scripts/build.sh
```

### Run local development server:
```bash
cd kpc-site
./scripts/serve.sh
```

Visit http://localhost:1111 to preview the site.

## Editions — the living homepage

The front page of the site is an **edition**: an art-directed editorial issue
composed around what the studio is doing right now. Seasonal editions are the
spine, with project editions interspersed. When an edition's time is over it
retires — whole and unchanged — to a permanent URL under `/editions/`, and a
new front page is composed.

- **Content**: one folder per edition in `content/editions/<slug>/index.md`.
  Front matter carries `kind` (season/project), `numeral`, `status`
  (staging / live / retired), `lifespan`, `cover`, `deck`, etc. The body is
  markdown using the editorial shortcodes: `plate`, `diptych`, `wallquote`,
  `marginalia`, `interlude`.
- **Rendering**: the homepage renders whichever edition has `status = "live"`
  (`templates/index.html` → `templates/editions/issue.html`). If none is live,
  it falls back to the old homepage. `/editions/` is the archive shelf.
- **Per-edition art direction**: drop an `edition.css` next to the edition's
  `index.md`; it loads after the shared base (`static/editions.css`) and can
  restyle anything. Each edition can look like its own work.

### Workflow

```bash
./scripts/edition.sh new 2026-autumn "Title Here" season   # scaffold (staged, draft)
./scripts/edition.sh serve                                  # live-reload incl. drafts
#   → preview at http://127.0.0.1:1111/editions/2026-autumn/
./scripts/edition.sh list                                   # see all editions + status
./scripts/edition.sh promote 2026-autumn                    # retire current, go live
```

Staged editions have `draft = true`, so **production builds never include
them** — you can push work-in-progress safely. `promote` removes the draft
flag, stamps dates, retires the previous edition, and flips its lifespan
to past tense.

## Adding New Content

### New Artwork:
1. Create new markdown file in appropriate category/year directory:
   `content/oeuvre/painting/2024/new-artwork.md`

2. Front matter format:
   ```toml
   +++
   title = "Artwork Title"
   date = 2024-01-15
   category = "painting"
   year = 2024
   image = "/images/2024/01/artwork.jpg"
   image_alt = "Description of the artwork"
   +++
   
   Artwork description goes here.
   ```

3. Add image to `static/images/YYYY/MM/`

### New Pages:
Create markdown files in `content/` with proper template reference.

## Deployment

The `public/` directory contains the complete static site ready for deployment to any static hosting service.

- **Netlify**: Connect to this repository
- **GitHub Pages**: Deploy from `main` branch  
- **Vercel**: Import repository
- **Traditional hosting**: Upload `public/` contents

## Migration Notes

### What was preserved:
- All artwork content and metadata
- Artist statement and biography
- Site structure and navigation
- Social media links
- URL structure (with redirects setup)

### What was improved:
- Faster loading times
- Better mobile experience  
- Easier content management
- No database dependencies
- Future-proof file formats

### Next Steps:
1. Download original images from Ghost site
2. Add them to `static/images/` with proper organization
3. Update any remaining content as needed
4. Configure domain and hosting
5. Set up redirects from old URLs if necessary

## Customization

- Edit `sass/style.scss` for styling changes
- Modify `templates/` for layout changes
- Update `config.toml` for site configuration
- Content managed in `content/` markdown files

## Support

This implementation prioritizes:
- **Long-term maintainability** (no breaking dependencies)
- **Performance** (minimal, optimized code)
- **Accessibility** (semantic HTML, proper contrast)
- **Simplicity** (easy to understand and modify)
