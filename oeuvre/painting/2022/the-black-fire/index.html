<h1>The Black Fire</h1>
<p>The Black Fire by kyle parker cunningham</p>
<p>A painting created in response to the Black Fire in the Aldo Leopold Wilderness during the spring of 2022. Oil on Linen. Twenty One by Thirty Four Inches. May 2022.</p>
<p>In May of 2022 the Black Fire started near Diamond Creek in the Aldo Leopold Wilderness near Truth or Consequences, New Mexico. I was beyond distraught about the burning of this area as it is a place near and close to our hearts. I painted this painting in the first few days of the fire as I watched the daily afternoon plumes blot of the sun and dirty the sky.</p>
<p>Fire is an important and natural part of the ecosystem but the fires we have today are monsters fueled by our changing climate and destructive beyond imagination. They are a reality of our modern world and it is hard to come to terms with the simple fact that I will watch many beloved wilderness burn every year for the rest of my life.</p>
