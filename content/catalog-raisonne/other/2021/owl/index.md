owl by kyle parker cunningham

oil on baltic birch panel
12x17.5 inches
painted 2012, reworked spring 2021

This painting was from a few years ago. I reworked this painting in April 2021 to how it is here.

I have mixed feelings about working on old paintings. On the one hand I love the old paintings, they have a piece of history of my life in them, they were a time and a place and they represent what I was capable of doing and what I was thinking at that moment. On the other hand I'm an infinitely better painter now than I ever have been. This owl, now, has more of my history representing it's form, owls are magical and deserve to look as good as possible.
