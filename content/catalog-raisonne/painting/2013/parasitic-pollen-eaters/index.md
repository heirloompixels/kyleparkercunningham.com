Parasitic Pollen Eaters by kyle parker cunningham

21 by 34 inches. Oil on Linen. 2013. Private Collection.

The bees build bubbles to protect themselves from the poisons dropped by drones on the human's crops. The bubbles allow them to gather pollen while not being infected. They take the pollen back to their beehive laboratory, work some bee alchemy and like magic pure, perfect honey is once again produced.
