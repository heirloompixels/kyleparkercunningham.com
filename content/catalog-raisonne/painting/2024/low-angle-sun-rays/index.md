low angle sun rays by kyle parker cunningham

Wonder, about water vapor, dust and light angles. Effortlessly floating down the spine of the continental divide transporting moisture and spores. Aimlessly re-sculpting top soil creating art works while simultaneously eroding them like Buddhist monks and sand mandala's. Endlessly enigmatic, effortlessly aloft.

Sunset approaches and everyone has eyes glued to the horizon.
