Octobat by kyle parker cunningham

Wild futures.

An Octopus whom has created the most magical hot air balloon you could possible imagine. (I'm definitely pretty sure she sewed it by hand.)

That Octopus, she is an acrobat so she is an octobat. An aquatic danced realized in the sky.

Mesmerizingly absurd.

Acrylic, Paint Marker, Latex Paint on found wood. 3.5 by 19.5 inches. 2019.
