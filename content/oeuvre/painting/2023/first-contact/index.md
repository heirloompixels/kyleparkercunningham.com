First Contact by kyle parker cunningham

Now, I'm in the depths of contemplation about what lies ahead. A convergence of disparate events – my life to this point, the weight of age, the global tumult – swirl in my thoughts. Reflections on the past and musings on the future collide, sparked into focus by a bolt from the heavens. I navigate this uncharted territory without a map, relying on intuition and an open heart to carve the correct path.
