there once was ice here by kyle parker cunningham

oil on linen
21x34 inches
Spring 2021

These polar bears, they learned how to blow glass and crafted mostly round bubbles to live in. They filled them with water and froze them solid and live inside one until it melts, escape and appear in the next bubble as if by magic. Or Imagination. Or space age teleportation technology.

Binary detritus of a bygone era.
