pink and yellow by kyle parker cunningham

exploring the world between the worlds
we float upon the land a horizon misting
into the sky folding the trees into the earth

![Oil painting featuring a grid of concentric circles in yellows, oranges, blues, and reds on a pink background, arranged in rows across a tall vertical composition.](/oeuvre/painting/2021/pink-and-yellow/WT-pinkenso-edit4.jpg)
