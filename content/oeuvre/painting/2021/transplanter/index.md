transplanter by kyle parker cunningham

oil on linen
16 x 20 inches
Spring 2021

Octopus tenderly tugging a coracle boat which has been planted with a magnificent Alligator Juniper tree. The tree is stressed but alive and I'm assured will make it just fine in it's new home some where out there in the mysterious middle of the ocean paradise these exquisite specimens are being gathered.
