Saturday Evening Owls by kyle parker cunningham

Acrylic and latex paint on Canvas. 20 by 30 inches. Spring 2022.

I adore owls and hear them most places I sleep outside. I'm fascinated by the conversations they have late at night when the human world is asleep and night creatures are left to their explorations.

This painting is of four of these wonders I have known, some by site and some by voice only but all of them for extended periods of time.
