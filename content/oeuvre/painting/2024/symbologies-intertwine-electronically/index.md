symbologies intertwine electronically by kyle parker cunningham

The modern intersection of ancient symbols and digital connectivity, where meaning flows through electronic pathways.

![Oil painting of geometric forms against a deep dark blue night sky — a large coral-orange triangular spire rises at center flanked by faceted golden and pale spheres, with a pink cloud above, small green trees below, and a network of red triangular wireframe lines connecting the shapes.](/oeuvre/painting/2024/symbologies-intertwine-electronically/symbologies-intertwine-electronically.jpg)
