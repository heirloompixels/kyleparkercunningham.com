the atmosphere's electric finger by kyle parker cunningham

Behold the awe which is the blinding light of lighting strikes when surrounded by the intense darkness of encroached clouds while miles away from domesticated electricity.

![Minimalist oil painting of angular, jagged lightning bolt shapes outlined in golden-yellow lines against a pale white-gray background, with the forms cascading from the upper left to a dense cluster in the lower right corner.](/oeuvre/painting/2024/the-atmospheres-electric-finger/the-atmosphere-s-electric-finger-good.jpg)
