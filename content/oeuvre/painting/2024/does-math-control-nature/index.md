does math control nature? by kyle parker cunningham

An exploration of the fibonacci sequence in nature, questioning whether mathematical patterns are the foundation of natural forms or merely our way of understanding them.

![Oil painting of a spiral form composed of segmented concentric arcs in coral, salmon, and rose tones with white gaps between the segments, centered on a soft pale pink background, evoking a mathematical spiral pattern found in nature.](/oeuvre/painting/2024/does-math-control-nature/does-math-control-nature-.jpg)
