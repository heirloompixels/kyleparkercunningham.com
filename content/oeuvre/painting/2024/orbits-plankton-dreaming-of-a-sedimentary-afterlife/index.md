orbits (plankton dreaming of a sedimentary afterlife) by kyle parker cunningham

Recycling atoms. This year's compost growing next year's garden. Millennia of plankton floating in the ocean transforming nutrients and sunlight into sedimentary stone: actually forming earth. The ocean floating as clouds back to aforementioned ancient rocks to dissolve the same exact atoms slowly back to the ocean from whence it birthed. Using that recycled rain water to grow this years garden.
