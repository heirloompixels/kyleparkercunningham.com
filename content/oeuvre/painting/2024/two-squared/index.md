two squared by kyle parker cunningham

An exploration of geometric form and balance, where two elements create a harmonious square composition.

![Oil painting of four concentric nested squares arranged in a two-by-two grid on a pale yellow background, rendered in warm oranges, yellows, reds, and pinks with each square varying in the number and tightness of its nested layers.](/oeuvre/painting/2024/two-squared/two-squared.jpg)
