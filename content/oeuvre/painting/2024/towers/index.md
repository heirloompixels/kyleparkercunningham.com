towers by kyle parker cunningham

Looking up at clouds, seeing their magnificent height and perspective. The sky becomes architecture, water vapor transformed into towers reaching toward infinity.

![Oil painting depicting a dramatic upward view of towering cumulus clouds rendered in thick, swirling white and gray brushstrokes against a vivid blue sky, the billowing forms rising vertically like architectural columns.](/oeuvre/painting/2024/towers/towers.jpg)
