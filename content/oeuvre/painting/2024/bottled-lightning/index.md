bottled lightning by kyle parker cunningham

On occasions, the electrons get out of balance. Randomly you just happen to be in that place at the wrong moment, right time and the atmospheres' electricity chooses to flow through your body. It's rare to be touched by the sky's electric finger, united between the heavens and the earth in a split moment of wonder. Slowly, the shock transforms into awe and you bottle up that experience and keep it on the shelf as a pretty object, and remember to remember the atmosphere often.
