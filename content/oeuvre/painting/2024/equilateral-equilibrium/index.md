equilateral equilibrium by kyle parker cunningham

Rationing time and energy. The artifacts of ones life in need of attention and devotion. Finite existence demands decisions. Life's quest to find balance; constantly wondering what lies around the next corner (if we just go a little bit further.) When too many of the triangles of life are out of balance I struggle and so I paint these three points where two lines meet with the utmost care in the hope they will help me towards equilibrium.

![Oil painting of dozens of concentric nested triangles in vibrant yellows, reds, pinks, greens, blues, and teals scattered across a white background in varying sizes and orientations.](/oeuvre/painting/2024/equilateral-equilibrium/equilateral-equilibrium-.jpg)
