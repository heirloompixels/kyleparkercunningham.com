out there, on the horizon, a solitary cloud by kyle parker cunningham

A proud cloud caught in the act of looking perfect while it though no one was looking.

For three days straight I gazed at the clouds attempting to decoding their structures. The transparencies, translucency, opacity, luminosity and hues. The sky fades, how to think about that. Abundance of daytime around the solstice and the puffs and tuffs of dew on wing up in the sky were delightful.
