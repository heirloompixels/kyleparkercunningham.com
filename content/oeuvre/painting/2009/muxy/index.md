Muxy by kyle parker cunningham

Japanese Ink & Oil on Linen Canvas. 34 x 55 inches. 2009. Private Collection.

Painted while working at Showdown Ski Area in the heart of the Little Belts up in cold wonderful Montana. This is the place of my youth and it was a magical summer Jeannie and I spent up there.

![Oil and Japanese ink painting on raw linen featuring surreal organic forms — colorful bulbous shapes in greens, blues, reds, and yellows cascade from the upper left, connected by twisting vines, tendrils, and a red flower against an exposed linen background.](/oeuvre/painting/2009/muxy/muxy.jpg)
