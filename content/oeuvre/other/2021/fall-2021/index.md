fall 2021 by kyle parker cunningham

A log book of November 2021.

Truth or Consequences, New Mexico

The first days of November have brought perfect fall weather. The type of fall I always dreamed fall could be while a child in Montana. Lingering, wonderful fall.

Work progresses on the new batch of paintings. Excitement for their completion.
