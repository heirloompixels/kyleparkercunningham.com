Cyclum Lunarem by kyle parker cunningham

I painted the moons from an entire summer, starting on the summer solstice and completed on the autumnal equinox.

Each moon is painted upon a 3 3/8" square prepared with linen and a traditional gesso ground. 24kt gold leaf was gilded upon this ground and the moon then painted upon this.

Installation size is variable based on shape as well as spacing between the moons.

This piece plays well with atmospheric light due to the gold leaf.
