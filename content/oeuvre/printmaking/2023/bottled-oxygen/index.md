Bottled Oxygen by kyle parker cunningham

The essential element contained, life-giving gas trapped in glass, where breath becomes commodity and nature becomes product.

![Intaglio print of two glass domes side by side: one sheltering a tree with yellow-green hand-colored foliage on yellow ground, and the other covering rounded pod-like structures on green ground, connected by a pipe with a valve on top.](/oeuvre/printmaking/2023/bottled-oxygen/bottled-oxygen-1-1.jpeg)
