In The Pines by kyle parker cunningham

Forest as sanctuary, where pine needles create their own sky and shadows tell ancient stories in vertical language.

![Intaglio print of six tall, slender pine trees in a row, each filled with hand-painted watercolor in varying shades of olive, emerald, and yellow-green, standing on a thin horizon line against a cream background.](/oeuvre/printmaking/2023/in-the-pines/in-the-pines-1--1--1.jpeg)
