balance by kyle parker cunningham

drypoint intaglio printmaking on rives bfk, handcolored with gouache
8 by 10 inches
2021

Finding balance in the forest. Everything is something and is something else at the same time. All is connected and coincidence rules the day. Tomorrow I find myself ideal in balance and rhythm with the trees.
