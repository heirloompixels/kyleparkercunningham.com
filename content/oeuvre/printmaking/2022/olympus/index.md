Olympus by kyle parker cunningham

This is one of my favorite typewriters of all time. Unfortunately it has a sticky "n" key, it works, but you get some type errors. That, though, is the cost of being analog!

A sheet of paper curls from the platen at the top of the composition.](/oeuvre/printmaking/2022/olympus/IMG_3937.jpeg)
