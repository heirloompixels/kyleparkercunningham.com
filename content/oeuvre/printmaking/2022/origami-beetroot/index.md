Origami Beetroot by kyle parker cunningham

Intaglio Drypoint Print.

![Intaglio drypoint print of a beetroot rendered in a geometric, origami-like style, centered in the composition with angular leaves radiating outward and two tall pointed shoots rising from the top. Dense crosshatching creates dark tonal depth in the round root body against a gray, textured background.](/oeuvre/printmaking/2022/origami-beetroot/IMG_3950-1.jpeg)
