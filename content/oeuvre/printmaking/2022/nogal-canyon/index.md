Nogal Canyon by kyle parker cunningham

I scratched this plate sitting in an arroyo in Nogal Canyon while on a camping trip with friends. This was near the windmill if you ever wanted to find the exact spot it would be down canyon from the windmill in the arroyo.

![Intaglio drypoint print of a layered rock formation with curved, columnar ridges rising vertically, topped by a gnarled tree with spreading branches. A wash of rust-orange watercolor colors the ground at the base, with crosshatched shadows adding depth to the canyon wall against a pale scratchy background.](/oeuvre/printmaking/2022/nogal-canyon/IMG_3967.jpeg)

![Another print of the Nogal Canyon drypoint plate without the watercolor accents, showing the same striated rock formation and twisted tree in pure black ink on white handtorn paper, emphasizing the fine drypoint line work and burr texture in the canyon wall and foliage.](/oeuvre/printmaking/2022/nogal-canyon/IMG_1094.jpeg)
