Skull by kyle parker cunningham

Intaglio drypoint prints. Printed area approx 6 x 9 inches. Handtorn paper approx 8 x 10 inches.

![Intaglio drypoint print of a human skull in three-quarter profile view facing left, with detailed crosshatched shading around the eye socket and temple. Subtle washes of pale green and blue-gray watercolor fill the cranium and jawline, giving dimension to the bone structure against the scratchy gray plate tone.](/oeuvre/printmaking/2022/skull/IMG_3973-1.jpeg)
