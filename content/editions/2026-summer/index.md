This season the studio has no walls. Through the summer Jeannie and I are working out of a vehicle
across Wyoming, Montana, and Colorado — climbing and painting in the mornings, swimming the heat off
at midday, documenting in the evenings, all of it running on a satellite signal and a battery. The
question underneath it is simple and practical: can the whole operation be *carried* — made small
enough, and durable enough, to keep making real, physical things from wherever the work happens to
be?

It is one investigation under a single name, *[Survival Notes from the Near
Future](/projects/survival-notes-from-the-near-future/)*: a practical guide and a meditation on
moving into a reality of computing and climate change without losing what makes us human. What comes
back from the road will gather here, week by week, all summer long.

**The 200.** Two hundred small watercolors — half mine, half Jeannie's — painted in the field and
each one unique. The first iteration of a larger idea, made entirely on the move. They go up for
sale beginning at the summer solstice.

<!-- PLATE SLOT: add a 200 painting once photographed —
     {{/* plate(path="...", alt="", title="", meta="watercolor · 2026") */}} -->

**Two books, bound in the forest.** First editions in the Sewn Boards structure: Wittgenstein's
*Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus*, chosen for what it says about the limits of language in the age of
the language model, and Whitman's *Leaves of Grass*, which Whitman set by hand. Austere limit against
catalogue-everything abundance — the conceptual engine of the whole summer. (More on the craft:
[Agile Meteor Press](/projects/agile-meteor-press/).)

The *Tractatus* was sewn and cased by headlamp in a creek bottom below the Wild Iris crags,
outside Lander, Wyoming — glue pot, awl, thread and boards laid out on a boulder while the light
went. A book about the limits of language, finished at the exact hour the light runs out.

**The Periodic, field-printed.** The small art newspaper, now run off a laser printer and a lithium
battery in the van — proof that a real publication can be made from the side of a road.

**The film.** An unhurried document of the making: a drone over open country, the press set up where
there are no walls, the landscape doing most of the talking.
