<p>Monsoon hovering; bored on the horizon.</p><p><em>Prelude:</em><br> It's been some years now that I've been in the desert and it's motions have solidified in my veins pulsing with blinding white intensity. The suns up high hanging on the horizon pushing the ground towards a certain level of dryness impossible to describe to those in more damp climes. And so it is of no surprise the rain is on the mind often. Climate nudges at the mind and polishes our tendency shaping our moods. Mostly these years have been about time and focus and memory and objects.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/rainfall/traingle_orange.jpg" width="1789" height="2048" loading="lazy" alt="Oil painting of an orange and pink geometric triangle composed of smaller triangles centered on a bright yellow background."></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/rainfall/vessel.jpg" width="1604" height="2048" loading="lazy" alt="Oil painting of a gray ceramic vessel covered in overlapping eyes with yellow-green irises against a pale gray background."></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/rainfall/wovenMatter.jpg" width="1317" height="2048" loading="lazy" alt="Oil painting of a stylized blue face with a geometric triangular patterned headdress on a long neck, rendered in muted blue-green tones against a pale background."></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/rainfall/yucca.jpg" width="2000" height="1688" loading="lazy" alt="Oil painting of a surreal creature with a single eye curled inside a sweeping green yucca leaf, with a small white flower and green plant at the base against a pale green background."></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/rainfall/zinias.jpg" width="2000" height="1271" loading="lazy" alt="Oil painting of colorful zinnias in pink, yellow, and orange blooming loosely from a glass jar, rendered in soft pastel brushwork against a pale green background."></div></div><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/rainfall/three_red_pears.jpg" width="2000" height="1521" loading="lazy" alt="Oil painting of three deep burgundy red pears standing side by side on a dark surface against a muted blue-gray background."></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="/rainfall/tex.jpg" width="2000" height="1551" loading="lazy" alt="Oil painting of a rainbow-striped cat walking across a dark brown background, its body rendered in bold vertical stripes of green, blue, pink, red, and yellow."></div></div></div></figure><p>A thousand tribulations until the waterfalls come forward and give us a proper chance.  We eat fireflies for dinner sometimes to keep the spark and the corner of our mouths clean.  We dip and dive asunder underneath a travelers moon;
